                <p>
                    When the atmosphere is filled with toxic gases released as result of industrial or other economic activities, it results in polluting the atmosphere and the air in the environment. This is nothing but air pollution.

                <h2>Garbage Pollution</h2>
                <p>
                    When we do not adhere to proper waste disposal mechanisms, waste accumulates, causing garbage pollution. So the only way to address this issue is to ensure a proper waste disposal system that does not contaminate the environment.
